<h3 id="vf-flim">Measuring Membrane Potential Optically</h3>

<img src="./images/composite_rmp_image.png" alt="composite of Vmem images">
<p>All cells maintain a membrane potential (V<sub>mem</sub>), or a voltage across their plasma membrane. Millisecond-timescale changes in V<sub>mem</sub> transmit information in excitable cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes. Resting V<sub>mem</sub> is present in all cells and has been implicated in diverse processes ranging from differentiation to body patterning. There is an unmet need for better tools to quantify V<sub>mem</sub> so that we can better understand how it functions as a signal in the body. Although patch-clamp electrophysiology is the gold standard for precise V<sub>mem</sub> recordings, it is low throughput, highly invasive, and intractable over long timescales.</p>

<p>To address this need, we developed and applied an optical method for recording absolute V<sub>mem</sub> with fluorescence lifetime imaging (dubbed "VF-FLIM"). VF-FLIM exhibits 100-fold improved throughput over patch-clamp electrophysiology and 20-fold improved voltage resolution over previously reported optical techniques. Using VF-FLIM, I uncovered a V<sub>mem</sub> response to epidermal growth factor stimulation in carcinoma cells and identified the ion channel that mediates this signal. You can read more about this work in <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.44522">eLife</a>.</p>

<p>Fluorescence lifetime imaging can also offer more detailed insight about how fluorescent sensors work, which is super informative if you're trying to develop better ones. In collaboration with some awesome synthetic chemists, I used fluorescence lifetime to better characterize photoinduced electron transfer in VoltageFluor dyes.
