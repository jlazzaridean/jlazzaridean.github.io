<h2>Current Role</h2>

<p>I'm a scientist at <a href="https://www.calicolabs.com/">Calico Life Sciences LLC</a>, where I develop cutting edge imaging technology as a member of the <a href="https://andrewgyork.github.io/">York Laboratory</a>.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>I started off in science at the University of Southern California, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Chemistry (Chemical Biology). I also stumbled into a minor in Computer Science, which has paid massive dividends over the years.</p>

<p>I went on to complete my Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley in <a href="http://millerchembio.com/">Prof. Evan Miller's lab</a>. This kicked off my love of for fluorescent sensor development and quantitative imaging. I worked on a <a href="./projects.html#vf-flim" target="_self">fluorescence lifetime-imaging based system for measuring voltages</a> in cells. I also had the fun opportunity to use imaging, in collaboration with synthetic chemists, to better <a href="./projects.html#anilines" target="_self">understand and design</a> photo-induced electron-transfer (PeT) based sensors.<p>

<p>I did postdoctoral research at UCSF in the <a href="https://www.altschulerwulab.org/">Altschuler and Wu lab</a>, where I worked on image-based phenotypic modeling of neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<p>When I'm not doing science, I love <a href="./veggies.html" target="_self">vegetable gardening</a>, playing board games, and trying new foods.</p>
